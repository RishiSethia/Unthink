and so on.

URLs:
/employees/ -- When this is hit, all the data in database shall be fetched
/employees/?chunk=() -- Use the chuck number if negative response error

Code Logic:-

    Consider, When no chunk/query parameter is provided
        - Fetch all data from database --
            3 Queries could be used (Queries yet to be designed following are just the pseudo queries) -- JSON AUTO at the end of query will covert the result to JSON format (Yet to try this haven't done this earlier)

            a = SELECT Emp CODE, Dept, Score WHERE Dept != 'Unthink' AND Date Created <= Now()-14days() sort by score
            b = SELECT Emp CODE, Dept, Score WHERE Dept = 'Unthink'
            c = SELECT Emp CODE, Dept, Score WHERE Date Created >= Now()-14days()

        Suppose,
        a, b, c are json for list with length 9, 4, 4 respectively
        lastIndex = 4 #Where the last entry was inserted
        for i in range(0, len(b),2)
            a.insert(lastIndex, b[i])
            a.insert(lastIndex+1, b[i+1])
            lastIndex=lastIndex+6

        lastIndex = 6 #Where the last entry was inserted
        for i in range(0, len(c),2)
            a.insert(lastIndex, b[i])
            a.insert(lastIndex+1, b[i+1])
            lastIndex=lastIndex+7
        Now 'a' will have the out in the format of 2.c

    Following are few scenarios on which I have doubt:-
    â€‹1. Point 2.b says, "Application will then return the results/employees sorted in descending order of score in JSON response" Is this post point 2.c manuplation? OR Point 2.b and 2.c will be sent as different results.
    2. What happens when any of the results list isn't to make the pattern as 4(first 4 enteries from a), 2(next 2 enteries from b), 2(next 2 enteries from c) and so on.
    For instance, a has only 2 results and b has 5 and c has 1, then what is the expected out put?

    When chunk given
        - Make queries as in above and store the data
        - All data needs to be fetched irrespective of chunk is given or not
        - if chunk = 3
        fetch result a[(chunk*20)-20:(chunk*20)-1] #Fetch index values 40 to 59
         
        #if chunk is 1 --- 0 to 19
        #if chunk is 2 --- 20 to 39
        and so on

    What if the length of result is 60 and chunk = 4, then what should the result be? as the index would be out of range.


Doubts response:-

1. Point 2.b says, "Application will then return the results/employees sorted in descending order of score in JSON response" Is this post point 2.c manuplation? OR Point 2.b and 2.c will be sent as different results.
A. All other employees' details which are not included in special cases i(,e 5th,6th, 7th, 8th row ) have to be arranged in descending order of score as shown in the document. I,e. after 7th row, you can see that the next 4 rows are also arranged in descending order of score in continuation with the first batch.

2. What happens when any of the results list isn't to make the pattern as 4(first 4 enteries from a), 2(next 2 enteries from b), 2(next 2 enteries from c) and so on.For instance, a has only 2 results and b has 5 and c has 1, then what is the expected out put?
A. Need to not worry about this scenario to keep the use case simple. You can insert the data in such a way that a similar scenario doesn't occur or in case you want to include it , then you can send 400 status with some appropriate status description. Note! it's only optional.

3. What if the length of result is 60 and chunk = 4, then what should the result be? as the index would be out of range.
A.  In such cases where the range of the list using chunk is going beyond the available length of result, you can send 400 status with some appropriate status description.
